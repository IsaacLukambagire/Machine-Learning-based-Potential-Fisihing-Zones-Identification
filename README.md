# Machine Learning based Potential Fisihing Zones Identification Uising Python

## Context and Research Gap
This project indicates a combination of data exploration, machine learning modeling, and result visualization in a scientific or environmental context to identify potential fishing zones. 
The aim was to detect potential fishing zones using data accumulated over the past years since the detection of the potential fishing zones can be a challenge sometimes, for instance, when there is cloud cover obstruction making it hard to depend on satellite data. Here, i employ various machine learning models to identify potential fishing zones for india  

## Brief Summary of the Project
The project involves data analysis and machine learning. Here are some key aspects.

Data Processing and Analysis: The project involves processing and analyzing a dataset that includes features related to sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, relative humidity, sea level pressure, air temperature, total cloudiness, and total fish catch data. Various Python libraries, such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, are used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Normalization and Preprocessing: There are steps for normalizing data using scikit-learn's preprocessing module, indicating the importance of scaling features for certain machine learning algorithms.

Visualization: The project involves visualizing data, including the creation of bar charts to display feature importances.

Machine Learning: Various machine laerning models were incorporated, namely; SVM, Boosted Tree, Descision Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest. 
For instance, there are indications of machine learning tasks, such as the use of the scikit-learn library. The inclusion of code related to Extra Trees Classifier, SVM (Support Vector Machine), feature importance analysis, and creation of training and testing sets suggests a machine learning aspect. The project included tasks like classification based on specific conditions.
